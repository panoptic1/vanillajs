// Until then, here are some “extra credit” projects you might want to work on.

// Convert the Show Password project to use a button instead a checkbox. Consider things like button state and screen readers.
// Modify the Word Count project to show the user what words they use most frequently, and how often they’re used.
// Build your own animated GIF search app using the Giphy API.
// Let users select the NY Times article categories they want to get articles for.
// Convert the Monsters! game into Minesweeper.
// Modify the Table of Contents plugin to support multiple heading levels (warning: this one is a lot harder than it sounds).
// Use the browser-native Geolocation API to get the user’s location for the Weather App.
// Let users add multiple locations to the Weather App, and save them between visits.
// Extend your DOM Library with helper functions that you find yourself using on lots of projects.
// Convert the Form Saver script into a plugin. Give users the ability to save/delete their form data instead of doing it automatically.
// Give users a way to set their own time for the Countdown Timer. Play a sound when the timer ends.
// Tie into real location data for the Places app.
// Add routing to the Places so that each place has its own page, with Google Map data and directions on how to get there.
