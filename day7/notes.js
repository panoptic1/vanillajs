//ADDING TEXT TO AN ELEMENT

//grab the div
const element = document.querySelector('div');

//get the text out of the div
let text = element.textContent
//console.log(text);


//This one replaces the text content in the DOM dynamically
//element.textContent = `You know what, world? Actually goodbye.`

//This one changes the DOM by appending the indicated value to the text that is already there.
//element.textContent += ` How are you doing today?`

//This one adds texts to the beginning of the text in the DOM
//element.textContent =  `Well look who it is. It's the world!` + element.textContent
